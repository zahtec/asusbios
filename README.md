### ‚ö†Ô∏è PLEASE READ FIRST ‚ö†Ô∏è

The UEFI BIOS settings for the motherboard I have used for this may be different than some others. If you would like me to include a setting haven't included, correct any false information, or update this readme to a newer BIOS version, please submit a new issue. Also, your BIOS version may not be updated or may be newer than this readme was last made for, please check the BIOS version by the title to your own. Here's how:

- Make sure your on the "Main" tab/menu
- Right at the top, under "BIOS Information," there should be your BIOS Version

This is a fully-fledged readme with a list of all Asus ROG UEFI BIOS settings and their purpose. As always, the BIOS version this readme was last updated for will be at the top so check what version you have before reading this just so you don't get confused.

As you might notice, the table of contents includes every tab/menu, even those that don't have settings in them. This is meant to be a bit of a guide, so all the options on these extra tab/menu will be listed with their purpose as well.

(If I ever fall behind and don't seem to be responding to issues, you are welcome to fork this and update it so people can continue using it)
